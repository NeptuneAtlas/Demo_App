# Demo_App

Inspiration:
I like apps that encourage speaking with other people and making connections in some form or another. Discord has actually been one of the best ways I made friends within the gaming community. So I figured an app where you can do this with other interest people have would be cool.

What it does:
It allows you to attend events where other people may attend showing that you have common interests. A good way to meet up with other people.
